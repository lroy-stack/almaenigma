# Execute PRP with Methodical Research & Strategic Implementation #ULTRATHINK PROACTIVELY

Implement a feature using PRP methodology with proper research order and strategic subagent consultation.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Core Methodology (KISS + YAGNI Principles)

**CRITICAL: Follow this exact order - análisis → evaluación → investigación → implementación** 

# Execute BASE PRP

Implement a feature using using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the PRP
   - Implement all the code

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass

5. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything

6. **Reference the PRP**
   - You can always reference the PRP again if needed

Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry.


### ✅ CORRECT Approach (Research-Focused):

**Phase 1 - ANÁLISIS:**
```
I will read the PRP and analyze existing codebase using Glob/Grep tools.
Todo: Understand current RLS implementation patterns
Todo: Map existing API route structures
```

**Phase 2 - EVALUACIÓN & INVESTIGACIÓN:**
```
Research delegation for knowledge gaps:
→ context7: "Research Next.js 15 App Router multi-tenant patterns"
→ general-purpose: "Analyze existing RLS policies in supabase/ directory"
→ web search: "Latest Supabase RLS performance optimization techniques"
```

**Phase 3 - IMPLEMENTACIÓN:**
```
Direct implementation by primary agent:

Validation consultation:
→ validation-gates: "Test my implemented RLS policies for security compliance"
→ documentation-manager: "Update docs for my new API endpoints"
```

### ❌ INCORRECT Approach (Over-Delegation):


## Decision Framework

**RESEARCH/CONSULT When:**
- Need specific documentation/examples you don't have
- Require domain expertise validation
- Need codebase pattern analysis

**IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY When:**
- Can use Write/Edit/MultiEdit/Bash tools
- Following patterns from research phase
- Standard development tasks

**Key Principle**: Subagents provide knowledge, you provide implementation.
